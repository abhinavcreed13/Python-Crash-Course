# --- Organizing a list ---

# -- sorting a list permanently: sort

cars = ['bmw','audi','toyota','subaru']

# - see all properties of cars object
#print(dir(cars))

# - sort in increasing order
# cars.sort()
# print(cars)

# - sort in decreasing order
# cars.sort(reverse=True)
# print(cars)

# -- sorting a list temporarily: sorted

# print(dir(cars))

# print("Here is the original list:")
# print(cars)

# # - sort in increasing order
# print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
# print(sorted(cars))

# # - sort in decreasing order
# print("\nHere is the sorted list in reverse order:")
# print(sorted(cars, reverse=True))

# print("\nHere is the original list again:")
# print(cars)

# -- Printing a list in reverse

# cars.reverse()
# print(cars)

# -- length of a list: len

# print(len(cars))

# -- 3 exercises now

# --- Avoiding Index Errors ---

#print(cars[-5])
